what is structure ?
Structure is a user defined data type in C language which allows you to combine data items of different kinds.

 
    we have different data types 
    int 
    char 
    float
    double
    long

    but what if we want to store multiple data types in a single variable ?
    for that we use structure


syntax :
struct structure_name
{
    data_type member1;
    data_type member2;
    data_type member3;
    .
    .
    .
    data_type memberN;
};
